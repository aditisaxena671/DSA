Question:

Geek is very fond of patterns. Once, his teacher gave him a pattern to solve. He gave Ram an integer n and asked him to build a pattern.
Help Ram build a pattern.

Example 1:

Input: 5
Output:
    *
   ***  
  *****
 *******
*********
Example 2:

Input: 3
Output:
  *
 ***  
*****
Your Task:
You don't need to input anything. Complete the function printTriangle() which takes an integer n  as the input parameter and prints the pattern.

Expected Time Complexity: O(n2).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Constraints:
1<= n <= 1000




Solution:

class Solution {

    void printTriangle(int n) {
        // code here
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
            
            for(int j=0;j<n-i-1;j++){
                System.out.print(" ");
            }
            for(int j=0;j<(2*i)+1;j++){
                System.out.print("*");
            }
            System.out.println();
        }
    }
}
