Question:

Given a singly linked list and a number k. Find the (n/k)th element, where n is the number of elements in the linked list. We need to consider ceil value in case of decimals.

Examples:

Input: LinkedList: 1->2->3->4->5->6 , k = 2
Output: 3
Explanation: 6/2th element is the 3rd(1-based indexing) element which is 3.

Input: 2->7->9->3->5 , k = 3
Output: 7
Explanation: The 5/3rd element is the 2nd element as mentioned in the question that we need to consider ceil value in the case of decimals. So 2nd element is 7.

Constraints: 
1 <= number of nodes <= 104
1 <= k <= number of nodes
1 ≤ node->data ≤ 103

Solution:

class Solution {
    public static int fractional_node(Node head, int k) {
        // Your code here
        int size=0;
        Node temp= head;
        while(temp!=null){
            size++;
            temp=temp.next;
        }
        int index = (int) Math.ceil((double) size / k);
        temp=head;
        while(temp!=null){
            if(index==1){
                return temp.data;
            }
            index--;
            temp=temp.next;
        }
        return -1;
    }
}
